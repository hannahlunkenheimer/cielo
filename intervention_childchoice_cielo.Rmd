## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Effects of age, religiosity, and control on interventionist concepts

HOW ARE WE MEASURING RELIGIOSITY????

## This R Markdown file includes the following, each separated into chunks:

1. Exploratory factor analysis to decide factor groupings in the intervention items
2. Histograms of each intervention item, split by gender
3. Linear regression models with age, control, gender for environment, people, and total intervention scores
4. Figures with predicted reg lines (by gender) for each environment, people, and total intervention scores

iii.	Effects of age, etc on “intervention frequency task” (Does God make..?). Would just sum number of yes responses as dv.
1.	Linear regression (+histogram of each question. Factor analysis to determine clusters)
