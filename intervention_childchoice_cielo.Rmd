# Effects of age, religiosity, and control on interventionist concepts - child choice

i.	Effects of age (and religiosity*) (and control**) on interventionist concepts - child choice (explicit concept) task

1.	Multinomial logistic regression
a.	Model with all 3 above (age, relig, control) + interactions = best fit model. Put all 3 parent variables into the model and take out if not predictive. Test for multicollinearity. If yes, then Principal Components Analysis.
