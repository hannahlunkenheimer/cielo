d_paola <- read_csv("Paola-Cielo coding copy.csv")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#total <- merge(d_paola, d_helen,by="pid")
#total = subset(total, select = -c(pid) )

for (dimension in 1:139) {
    v = paste0("V", dimension)
    print(irr::kappa2(cbind(d_helen[, v], d_paola[, v])))
}

#overall IRR is .769
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
