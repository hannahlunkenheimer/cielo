```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "png",
                      dpi = 300,
                      echo = FALSE,
                      cache = TRUE)

# importing the data
d_all <- read_csv("data/Cielo1_MergedFull_practice.csv")

# now let's view our data
#View(d_all)

# some participant data needs to be thrown out completely according to the red rows in our CSV file, so let's remove those participants completely here (ID 129, 152, 175, and 277)
subset(d_all, id_num != "129" & id_num != "152" & id_num != "175" & id_num != "277")
# great, we've removed our 4 participants completely from our dataframe d_all and now have all of the participants we can use for analyses
```

## Recoding everything

```{r recoding variables}
# gender
d_all$gender <- dplyr::recode(d_all$gender, 'Male' = 1, 'Female'=2)

# control
d_all$control...6 <- dplyr::recode(d_all$control...6, 'Really Disagree' = 6, 'Disagree'=5, 'Kind of Disagree' = 4, 'Kind of Agree' = 3, 'Agree' = 2, 'Really Agree' = 1)

# religiosity
d_all$relig_attendserv <- dplyr::recode(d_all$relig_attendserv, 'Never' = 1, 'Less than once a year'=2, 'A few times a year' = 3, 'A few times a month' = 4, 'A few times a week' = 5, 'Daily' = 6)
d_all$relig_tradition <- dplyr::recode(d_all$relig_tradition, 'Not at all important' = 1, 'Minimally important'=2, 'Moderately important' = 3, 'Very important' = 4)

# sure
d_all$exist_sure_god <- recode(d_all$exist_sure_god, 'A little sure' = 1, 'Very sure' = 2)


```

## Creating scores
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
